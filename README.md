# Scheduling-Simulator
Simulate real time and non real time scheduling algorithms
# Description
This is a web application which simulate Real time and Non Real time CPU scheduling algorithms.<br/>
NON-RTS algorithms include-FCFS,PREEMPTIVE SJF,NON-PREEMPTIVE,ROUND ROBIN<br/>
RTS algorithms include-EARLIEST DEADLINE FIRST-SINGLE PROCESSOR AND MULTI PROCESSOR,DEADLINE MONOTONIC,LEAST SLACK TIME FIRST,RATE MONOTONIC-SINGLE AND MULTI-PROCESSOR<br/>
# Working
Add the project to xampp server- C:\xampp\htdocs<br/>
Run index.php file and you are good to go.
